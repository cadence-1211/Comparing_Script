Of course. I will provide a detailed, line-by-line explanation of all three scripts.

First, a very important point: As a language model, I can only generate text. I cannot create PDF or MP3 files directly.

However, I will provide you with a well-structured text explanation that you can very easily use to create these files yourself:

To create a PDF: Copy the complete text of my explanation below and paste it into a word processor like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice. Then, simply use the "Save as PDF" or "Print to PDF" option.

To create an MP3: You can use a free text-to-speech (TTS) website or software. Just copy the text of each section into the TTS tool, and it will generate the audio for you to download as an MP3 file.

Detailed Code Explanation

Here is the detailed breakdown of the three scripts in your workflow.

Script 1: launch_comparison.py

Overall Purpose: This is the master control script. Think of it as the "Project Manager." Its job is to talk to you (the user) to get all the necessary information, and then use that information to prepare the work (by splitting the files) and delegate it (by submitting the jobs to LSF). You only run this script once at the very beginning.

Generated python
# File: launch_comparison.py
# Purpose: The main script to start the entire process.

# --- Block 1: Importing Libraries ---
# These are tools the script needs to perform its tasks.
import os                   # Lets the script interact with the operating system, like checking for files and creating directories.
import argparse             # A standard library to help create command-line interfaces (though we use it minimally here).
import subprocess           # The most important tool for this script. It allows Python to run external commands, specifically 'bsub'.

# --- Block 2: The 'get_instance_key' function ---
# This small helper function reads one line of a file and extracts the instance key.
def get_instance_key(line, key_cols):
    """Extracts the key from a line for sharding."""
    parts = line.strip().split()            # 1. Takes a line, removes any leading/trailing whitespace (`strip`), and splits it into a list of words (`split`).
    if len(parts) <= max(key_cols):         # 2. Checks if the line has enough columns. If not, it can't get the key.
        return None                         # 3. Returns 'None' (nothing) if the line is too short.
    return "_".join(parts[i] for i in key_cols) # 4. If the line is valid, it picks the words from the columns you specified (`key_cols`) and joins them with an underscore to make a single key (e.g., "inst_ABC_01").

# --- Block 3: The 'shard_file' function ---
# This is the core logic for splitting one large file into many smaller ones.
def shard_file(input_file, key_cols, num_shards, output_dir):
    """Reads a large file and splits it into smaller shards based on a key."""
    print(f"-> Processing {input_file}...")

        os.makedirs(output_dir)             # 2. If it doesn't exist, it creates it.
        print(f"-> Created output directory: '{output_dir}'")
        
    # 3. This line prepares for writing. It opens a set of empty files to write to (e.g., shard_0.txt, shard_1.txt, etc.), one for each job.
    output_files = [open(os.path.join(output_dir, f"{os.path.basename(input_file)}_shard_{i}.txt"), "w") for i in range(num_shards)]
    
    with open(input_file, "r", errors='ignore') as f: # 4. Opens the giant input file for reading.
        line_count = 0
        for line in f:                      # 5. Reads the giant file ONE line at a time. This is very memory-efficient.
            line_count += 1
            if line_count % 5000000 == 0:   # 6. A simple progress indicator that prints a message every 5 million lines.
                print(f"   ...processed {line_count // 1000000}M lines of {os.path.basename(input_file)}")
            if not line.strip() or line.strip().startswith("#"): # 7. Skips any empty lines or lines that are comments.
                continue
            key = get_instance_key(line, key_cols) # 8. Gets the instance key for the current line using the helper function from Block 2.
            if key is None:
                continue
            
            # 9. This is the "magic" of sharding. `hash(key)` turns the key string into a unique, large number. The modulo `%` operator gives the remainder when that number is divided by `num_shards`.
            # This guarantees that the same key will ALWAYS result in the same shard_index.
            shard_index = hash(key) % num_shards
            
            # 10. Writes the current line into the correct small file based on the calculated index.
            output_files[shard_index].write(line)
            
    for file_handle in output_files:      # 11. After processing the whole file, this loop closes all the small output files.
